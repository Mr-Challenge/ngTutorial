<!--
One of the strongest part of jQuery is to perform DOM Manipulation. 
Angular team doesn't want to createt this functionality they want to retain it from jQuery
angular uses a subset of jQuery called jQlite.

Using AngularJS we cannot use Selectors, it supports only the methods from jQuery which performs 
DOM Manipulations

if jquery is added we can access all the methods, if not we can access only the subset (jQlite) methods
implemented by AngularJS from jQuery.

//Accessing the DOM using DOM API
var dom = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
//Converting DOM Object to jQlite Object
var jQliteObj = angular.element(dom);
// with this jQlite object we can access only the methods which performs DOM Operations

In order to use all the jQuery Methods, we need to include jquery.js

Eventhough we include jQuery we are supposed to use angular.element to work with all the jQuery Methods
jQuery === angular.element
$ === angular.element
