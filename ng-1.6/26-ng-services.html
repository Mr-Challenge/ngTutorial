<!--
Service is nothing but which does some sort of work.
In AngularJS all your business logic needs to be defined via services
Services are singleton (Only one instance will be created)
Services are Lazy loaded (Until it is called it wont get executed)
Services can be injected (Injector Service will take care of Dependency Injection)
In Angular 1.x we can create 5 types of services

In angular all providers will have a service. For instance

$InterpolateProvider will have $Interpolate Service. 

Inorder to Use Provider we need to Suffix 'Provider' otherwise it will be considered as Service

You can inject the providers only in your bootstrap .config() blocks before all instances are generated.
